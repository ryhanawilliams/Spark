                            <p>Spark Hackathon x Case Competition is a 24-hour innovation challenge where students come together to design, prototype, and pitch creative solutions to a real-world problem. By combining the hands-on building of a hackathon with the strategic thinking of a case competition, Spark pushes participants to go beyond coding and think deeply about why their solutions matter.</p>
                            
                            <p>At Spark, teams of up to 4 are challenged with a real-life case, centred on social good, an issue that impacts communities locally or globally. 
                            <p>Spark is designed for everyone: developers, designers, entrepreneurs, and anyone excited to solve meaningful problems. It's a space where students work collaboratively, learn new skills, and innovate for causes that drive positive change.</p>

                            <p>A hackathon is a fast-paced event where people come together to build creative projects usually over 12–36 hours. Participants form teams, brainstorm ideas, and develop solutions using coding, design, and problem-solving. It's a space to learn new skills, meet others in tech, and turn an idea into something real in a short amount of time.</p>
